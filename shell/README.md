# Shell Scripts

Files:
- iictl:  A utility tool to view logs of `ii`, the minimal IRC client from suckless-tools.
- srv-sw: I was lazy to figure out why `tor` and `i2p` could not run simultanously on my VPS (probably run out of memory).
          This script toggles the running service between `tor` and `i2p`, alternatively and updates my firewall rules accordingly.
- vps-av: I couldn't be arsed to check BuyVM's available stocks every time trying to buy one. Should have made it to mail me as well.
